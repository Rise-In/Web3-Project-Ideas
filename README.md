## Games and NFTs

### [Solitaire-NFT](https://github.com/ElAbel0990/Solitaire-NFT) (Explanation is only [here](https://ethglobal.com/showcase/solitaire-nft-j65p8))
- This is a solitaire game where you connect your wallet to the game to win NFTs. There are three tiers of NFTs based on how fast you beat the game. The bronze is for between 10 and 15 minutes, silver for five to ten minutes and gold where you finish for under five minutes. Based on that performance, the user receives an NFT. If the time it takes to win exceeds fifteen minutes, the user automatically wins without receiving an NFT prize.
